## Welcome to Learning Assistant

You can use our fibonacci spaced learning to learn new skills efficiently using the fibonacci method with a nice and convenient UI.



## Why does the ‘Fibonacci method’ work?
Before you can repeat something you obviously have to go through it, do it, or learn it first. The problem after doing or learning most things, especially if you have learned a lot of content, is that your mind will start slipping and you can no longer remember what you learned. However, if you repeat what you learned you will know it a bit better than before you repeated it. And since you now know it a bit better than before, you can now wait a bit longer before reviewing it again.

The same will be the case after repetition nr. 2, nr. 3 and so forth, and after some time the content will be well planted in your long-term memory. This structure goes nicely with the so-called ‘Fibonacci sequence’, and following the Fibonacci sequence for repetition is a known way to make learned content stick in your brain

## What is a Fibonacci sequence and how can it help learn new things efficiently ?
A Fibonacci sequence adds the previous number in a line to the current number. The sequence starts like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 (etc). The system is that you take a number in the sequence, for example, 3, and add the previous number; 2. Which makes 5. Then you add 5 to 3 and get 8. Then 8 + 5 = 13, 13 + 8 = 21, and so on.

To translate this into a learning tip: It works well to read something on day 1 and repeat it on day 2. Then you read it again on day 3, day 5, day 8, day 13, and maybe day 21. After this point, it might just stick, or you can repeat it after a while. The sequence suggests that you repeat it after 34 days, but of course, the exact number of days is not really the point. The point is to repeat content frequently in the beginning and keep repeating it less frequently in time. This way you can time how often you review learning material, using this kind of a “Fibonacci Study plan“. After a while, it is often recommended to repeat every other month or so instead of counting days.
